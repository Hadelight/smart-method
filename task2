we program the ESP32 mainly with Arduino IDE
There’s an add-on for the Arduino IDE allows you to program the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and its programming language.
1- Upload Code to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE
Blink */
// ledPin refers to ESP32 GPIO 23 const int ledPin = 23;
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() {
// initialize digital pin ledPin as an output.
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); }
// the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() {
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
2- Plug your ESP32 development board to your computer and follow these next instructions:
3- Go to Tools > Board, scroll down to the ESP32 section and select the name of your ESP32 board. In my case, it’s the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board.
2) Go to Tools > Port and select a COM port available.
  
4- Press the upload button
That’s it!
Note: If you get the following error when trying to upload code, it means that your ESP32 is not in flashing/uploading mode.
